## Signing classification

```text
class: UNSIGNED_DEVELOPMENT_RC
```

- Authenticode on portable: `NotSigned`
- Authenticode on NSIS setup: `NotSigned`
- No cert env keys present
- Allowed overall **PASS** when classified (task contract)
- **No SIGNED claim**

## Scenario results RC-01..RC-06

| ID | Name | Result | Mode / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RC-01 | Clean install | **PASS** | `nsis_silent` `/S /D=<tmpdir>` → `tracer-desktop.exe` found |
| RC-02 | Fake-runtime smoke | **PASS** | process alive + ready marker + clean shutdown |
| RC-03 | Upgrade | **PASS** | `no_prior_fixture` — honest non-claim (no `TRACER_RC_PRIOR_INSTALL`) |
| RC-04 | Uninstall | **PASS** | `nsis_silent_uninstall` via `uninstall.exe /S` |
| RC-05 | Reinstall | **PASS** | second silent NSIS install → exe found |
| RC-06 | Failed launch diagnostics | **PASS** | missing PE spawn path yields ENOENT / diagnostic signal |

### Overall

```text
RESULT: PASS
signing: UNSIGNED_DEVELOPMENT_RC
```

## Honesty notes

1. **RC-03** did not prove multi-version upgrade against an older released RC; fixture unset → documented `no_prior_fixture` PASS.
2. **Signing** is development-unsigned; production cert + CI secrets are follow-on work.
3. **MSI** intentionally not built for this RC.
4. RC-02 is **process-level** smoke with fake ACP — not a full WebView product journey (W2.3-B).
5. `tools/tauri-e2e` core reliability remains owned by W2.3-C.

## Integration re-build (W2.3-I / Gate 2.3)

Rebuilt on integrated tree (`integration/tracer-w2-3`) after C→A→B merges.
